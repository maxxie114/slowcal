# These pins were chosen to match your environment.yml pip entries so the sjsu env is reproducible for cloud deploy.
# After installing, run npx playwright install (or playwright install) if you rely on Playwright browser automation.
# If deploying to a container (Docker) you may prefer to install most heavy lower-level packages via conda in the image and keep pip for Python-only packages; I can help create a minimal Dockerfile if you'd like.
